stages:
- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: Grenoble to Belley
  Stats: 176 KM / 5200 M
  Mainclimbs: Porte, Granier, Epine, Mont du Chat
  Description: The Chartreuse stage, with special views over the Lac du Bourget. Big
    climbing from km 2, this stage sets the flavour for the whole event. After the
    Classic Climb up to the Granier the stage explores lesser known roads, culminating
    with the formidable Mont du Chat (reputedly one of the hardest treasures in the
    Alpine cupboard).
- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Belley to Annecy
  Stats: 194 KM / 5100 M
  Mainclimbs: Richemond, La Biche, Grand Colombier, Semnoz
  Description: A transition stage from the demanding climbs of the Ain region, including
    the Grand Colombier which many have called the toughest of the whole event in
    the past, to the gateway of the High Alps. The Semnoz climb provides the final
    to this tough stage but the first view of Mont Blanc from it’s summit sweep away
    the pain effectively!
- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Annecy to Albertville
  Stats: 179 KM / 5050 M
  Mainclimbs: Plan Bois, Croix Fry, Saisies, Arpettaz
  Description: From the shores of Lake Annecy we climb to the Forclaz summit to savour
    one of the most reputed Alpine views. Severe climbs follow in rapid succession,
    the Plan Bois being amost Pyrenean in character as we wind our way to Albertville.
    The Arpettaz climb repeatedly ‘steals’ this stage. You wil see why….
- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Albertville to Bourg St Maurice
  Stats: 140 KM / 4350 M
  Mainclimbs: Pré, Cormet de Roseland, La Rosiere, Petit St Bernard
  Description: The shortest stage but packed with quality. From the unkown Col de
    Cyclotouristes, to the beauty of the Cormet de Roseland and on to the Petit St
    Bernard, via La Rosiere ( both featured in the Tour 2018) , this stage is again
    full of Alpine Best !
- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: Bourg St Maurice to Cesana Torinese
  Stats: 182 KM / 5510 M
  Mainclimbs: Iseran, Mont Cenis, Finestre, Sestriere
  Description: Perhaps the Queen Stage of the event, with the mighty Iseran opening
    the way to Italy via Mont Cenis, before our gravel treat of the event - the formidable
    Colle di Finestre. The descent to the foot of the final Setriere climb affords
    some more spectacular scenery to ensure one of the most memorable Alpine stages
    possible!
- Stage: REST DAY
  Locations: Cesana Torinese
  Description: REAL Italian pizza and gelato here we come !
- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Cesana Torinese - Gap
  Stats: 190 KM / 4,500 M
  Mainclimbs: Col d'Izoard, Sainte-Apollinaire, Mont Colombis
  Description: Another Italian-Franco stage, and one which promises a mix of the classics
    and unknown gems. The Izoard is always a special treat, but the latter part of
    the route with the views over the Lac de Serre-Poncon, and then the Mont Colombis
    will leave an impression equally as lasting.
- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Gap - Alpe d'Huez
  Stats: 202 KM / 5,800 M
  Mainclimbs: Col du Noyer, Moissiere, Parquetout, Ornon, Solude, Alpe d’Huez
  Description: After an early loop around the hills north of Gap, we head up onto
    the Devoluy Plateau via the Col du Noyer. The rolling roads that follow eventually
    bring us to the Col d'Ornon, from where we end the stage with a dramatic duo of
    the little-known Solude climb and the old favourite that is the Alpe d'Huez.
- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Alpe d'Huez Loop
  Stats: 207 KM / 6,100 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de Glandon, Croix de Fer, Galibier, Sarenne
  Description: The CCC version of the Marmotte Cyclo-sportive route, with more kilometres
    & more climbs, including a lesser-ridden loop behind St Michel de Maurienne, as
    well as the Col de Sarenne.
- Stage: Stage Nine
  Locations: Alpe - Vassieux-en-Vercors
  Stats: 194 KM / 3,700 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de la Morte, Menée, Rousset
  Description: The Col de Morte opens the penultimate day’s climbing before we head
    into the Drome and then the Vercors for some more fun. Steady rather than steep
    climbs mark this stage, typified by the final long but gentle climb up to the
    Col de Rousset.
- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Vassieux - Grenoble
  Stats: 172 KM / 3,500 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de Chalimont, Machine, Pra l’Etang
  Description: The drama of the Vercors roads provide a fitting way to end this event.
    The Combe Laval / Col de la Machine section is often quoted as one of the most
    impressive roads in France and, followed by the Pra l’Etang, you’ll never forget
    this Northern Alps grand finale.
