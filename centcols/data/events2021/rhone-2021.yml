  Mainclimbs: Pré Coquet, Mont Ferrier, Montaud, Saint Nizier
  Description: "(Rhone, Vercors) After a gently rolling start the day begins properly

    woodland followed by wide open plateaux : the Vercors is hard to beat for untouched
    beauty and 'landscape sculpture'."

  Description: "( Vercors) A second chance to take in the wonders of the Vercors.

    the Rhone valley for a gentle stage finish. "

- Stage: Stage 4
  Locations: Crest to Malaucene
  Stats: 214 kms / 4300m
  Mainclimbs: Pennes, Soubeyrand, Mont Ventoux
  Description: "(Drome, Vaucluse) The Drome region is a harsh, arid and wild place,
    so roads are quiet and houses are scarce. Our first climb ( Pennes) is equally
    as harsh as the landscape, but therein lies its beauty! As we head south, the
    Bald Giant of Provence will begin to appear in the haze. We eventually circumnavigate
    this legend on its north side and then climb it from Sault, perhaps its less tough
    side, but there is no bland side on this very special mountain.. "

- Stage: Stage 5
  Locations: Malaucene to Vallon Pont d'Arc
  Stats: 189 kms / 2,000m
  Mainclimbs: Pozat, "Corniche des Cevennes".
  Description: '(Vaucluse, Gard, Ardeche) A transition stage that will be a welcome
    ''flatter'' stage by CCC standards. Nevertheless we will ride some superb roads,
    not least the full length of the dramatic "Corniche des Cevennes", used for a
    TT stage by the Tour de France in 2016. That stage ended in our Rest Day town
    of Vallon Pont d''Arc. '

  Stats: 203 kms / 4,000m
  Mainclimbs: Portes, Barraque, Uglas, Pierre Levée
  Description: "( Cevennes) We head into the heart of the least populated region of
    France here. Narrow roads, dense woodland, infinity views of multi-horizons. This
    region has some of the most beautiful roads for riding to be found anywhere in
    France. "

- Stage: Stage 7
  Locations: Le Vigan to Mende
  Stats: 197 kms / 4,600m
  Mainclimbs: Mont Aigoual, Finiels, Croix Neuve ("Mur Jalabert")
  Description: '(Cevennes) This stage is bookmarked by two Big Names. The Mont Aigoual
    features in this year''s Tour de France. It is the grandest of all the climbs
    in this area and has recorded wind speeds faster than on Mont Ventoux. The "Mur"
    up to the airport in Mende has featured several times in the Tour, always providing
    huge drama for its summit finish. In between lies the fabulous charm of the lesser-ridden
    roads of this great National park. '

- Stage: Stage 8
  Locations: Mende to Privas
  Stats: 207 kms / 4,000m
  Mainclimbs: 'Coulet, Meyrand, Pendu, Juvinas, Fayolle. '
  Description: "(Ardeche) Fewer open plateaux, more tight gorges; fewer steady climbs,
    more 'ramps'. More bridges. Such is the character of the Ardeche, whose real character
    we discover in this stage. No big-name climbs, just endless beauty. Not bad, really. "

  Stats: 197 kms / 4,300m
  Mainclimbs: Couberon, Faye, Mezilhac, Nonieres, Le Trascol
  Description: "( Ardeche) A sustained succession of steady climbs shapes this stage
    which takes us almost due north. Our last chance to savour the remoteness of this
    very special region which by this stage will have all riders under its charm!"

- Stage: Stage 10
  Locations: Satilleu to Chasse-s-Rhone (Lyon)
  Stats: 162 kms / 2,800m
  Mainclimbs: Croix de Chabouret, Pavezin, Grenouze
  Description: "(Auvergne-Rhone Alps).A second chance to explore the Pilat National
    Park. A gentler stage to finish this event will be welcome. Overall, although
    daily ride stats are not on the heavy side by CCC measures, this event is tougher
    than it looks on paper. However, it does have less steep percentage climbs than
    many other CCC's. An excellent choice for those who seek peaceful, remote riding
    and are less concerned about filling their 'bucket list'!"
