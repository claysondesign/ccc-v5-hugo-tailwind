- Stage: Stage 24
  Locations: Ales &ndash; Ales
  Stats: 208kms /  3200m
  Mainclimbs: Many of the Ardechoise favourites
  Description: This is the first of two stages which explore the best roads of the
    extremely popular, multi-day "Ardechoise" sportive. Although the collective total
    of climbing is not excessive, the road is rarely flat. It's tough terrain,  full
    of such charm and character. This remote area of France is one of the most genuinely
    surprising areas to ride in you can find. It needed a loop stage such as this
    to have time to explore its dense network of narrow roads.

  Locations: Aubenas &ndash; Chaumont Le Bourg
  Stats: 200 kms / 3900m
  Mainclimbs: Mezilhac, Mont Gerbier
  Description: 'Another feast of remoteness. This stage will take us from the northern
    reach of the Ardeche, around the town of Le Puy ( capital of the very special
    volcanic Puy region) and into the vast wooded region of the Livardois. We rode
    this in 2017, but here we ride a new version in the opposite direction. '

  Stats: 184kms / 3600m
  Mainclimbs: Mont Dore ( Col de Croix St Robert)
  Description: 'The second of the original CCC Cevennes stages ridden ''backwards''.
    The spectacular road up onto the Mont Dore will undoubtedly provide a superb finale
    to a stage which takes us to the northern tip of our journey, a mere 80 kms south
    of Clermont Ferrand. '

  Locations: Laguiole &ndash; Florac
  Stats: 204kms / 3700m
  Mainclimbs: Aubrac, Trebatut,Montmirat
  Description: 'The Aubrac National Park is a wild, desolate place populated mainly
    by its very distinct rusty-coloured cows. It''s an impressive place to ride through.
    This stage ends in Florac, close to the Gorges du Tarn, which offer more drama
    of a different kind. '

- Stage: Stage 30
  Locations: Florac &ndash; Montpellier
  Stats: 196kms / 3600m
  Mainclimbs: Espinas,Mont Aigoual, Minier.
  Description: 'The final stage in this exceptional region includes the mountain which
    perhaps defines the character of this area better than any other : Mont Aigoual.
    We approach it via the "best side" and combined with the Col de Minier has the
    making for an unforgettable ride. After riding up to the ''roof'' of the Cevennes
    our route takes us through some more stunning landscape and villages on our way
    down to sea level where we finish just outside Montpellier. The 65RIDE will then
    take a break of three weeks before re-starting with Event 4 from this same point.
    Destination the Pyrenees and then Cantabrico.  '
