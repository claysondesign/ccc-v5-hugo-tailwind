intro_text: If you are looking to enhance your collection of iconic road climbs seeped
  in Grand Tour history, then these ten stages will see you sorted for a while. Even
  though we also spend many kilometres on roads much less ridden. The French Alps
  do a good imitation of the Italian flair for roads that are ‘perfection-on-two-wheels’,
  and have also played host to so many of the legendary battles of the Tour de France.

Every stage of this route contains at least one, usually several, of these reknowned climbs. But ‘the ones that the Tour missed’ are also threaded into the mix , as is the way on any CCC event. Giant cols such as the Galibier, the Alpe d’Huez and the Iseran stand out above pearls such as the Arpettaz, the Cyclotourists and the Mont Colombis , and yet the latter will be remembered just as fondly.
This event includes many summits over 2,000m altitude which is usually a catalyst for drama – high passes rarely deliver a straight-forward ride. Often they will test your resistance to harsh conditions. Sometimes they will feed you war stories to dine out on. BUT always they will give you memories to treasure.

{{< testimonial cite="Ben Stephens, CCC Rider 2012, 2014, 2017" >}}
A CCC enables me to immerse myself with people all simply trying to bring out the best in each other... no drama, no negativity, no jealousy or aggression.  Regardless of experience and ability. A rare situation in our world.
