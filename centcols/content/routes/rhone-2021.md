The stunning contrast between the east and west flanks of the Rhone valley is what this event is built upon. " I have always wanted to design a ride through both sides of the Rhone to exemplify the definition of the beauty and character of southern France. It also happens to offer some of the best riding I have yet discovered" ( Phil D.)
