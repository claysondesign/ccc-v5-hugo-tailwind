(PHOTO :  and after our rides we watch THE MEN show us!)

8 days of hArd riding with the best group I've had for years : we rode the "Liege-Luxembourg Double " to end the week in all weathers and on all types of "roads". Another group of riders who have learnt that riding WITH each other rather than AGAINST each other make such a better ride. Thanks guys. More images will follow soon.
