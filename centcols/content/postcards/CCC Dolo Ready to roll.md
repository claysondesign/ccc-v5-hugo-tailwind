Our hotel at San Pellegrino Terme is perhaps my #1 favourite hotel from which to start a CCC Journey. You can drink the atmosphere here : the tight buzzing Valle Brembana; the 19th century grandeur of the 200-room 'Grand Hotel' currently being renovated and granted a second life and the overly-ornate casino and themas baths behind our hotel; the  six Gelateria within a short walk.....and most of all, the towering worded "hills" all around us that force our neck upwards as we seek the skyline. Perfectissimo !!

PS. Note the super-comfy new handlebars I am using : Wave Bars. So simple >> HUGE difference to my ride ! [https://www.coefficient.cc](https://www.coefficient.cc "https://www.coefficient.cc")
