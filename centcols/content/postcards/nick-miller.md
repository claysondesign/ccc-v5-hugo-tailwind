On Friday 20th September 2019 Nick would have celebrated his 61st birthday. But he died from a heart problem whilst on out on his bike with friends on the 17th November 2018. Although he loved his local hills, the French Pyrenees held a huge place in his heart, most especially the area around Luz-St-Sauveur and Argeles-Gazost. Amongst many of his cycling accomplishments, he rode SIX Cent Cols Challenges between 2009 and 2017. He rode the Pyrenees route twice, such was his love of this area.

The 2019 Cent Cols Challenge West Pyrenees will be riding one of the toughest stages of the event on Friday 20th September, starting from and ending in Argeles-Gazost. This stage will, for this unique celebration, serve as a Memorial Ride for Nick. The aim will be to share a ride with as many cyclists who knew Nick as possible. Entry will be limited to CCC riders and to all those who knew and rode with Nick in the UK.

Since the CCC full route includes two « up & back » climbs, riders will be able to choose between four route options. All four routes include the Col du Tourmalet.

* Option 1 : Full route : 205kms, 6,000m of climbing. Includes the following Cols : Courade, Tourmalet, Tentes, Hautacam. [See route](https://www.putmebackon.com/map.htm?E=120&S=1716)
* Option 2 : Without the Col des Tentes : 140kms, 4,500m of climbing.
* Option 3 : Without the Hautacam : 180kms, 5,200m of climbing
* Option 4 : Without the Col des Tentes and the Hautacam : 115 kms, 3,700m of climbing.

It will be possible to choose any of these options during the ride, at the base of the « up & back » climbs.
