Once again I find myself back at home with so many moments to look back on.

CCC Riders created rides together that words just cannot describe. Each rider comes away with their own cupboard full of personal treasures. They will open up that special place often over the next few months and hopefully will feed off the latent energy that lies there.

It will provide Motivation Fuel for the training months that will once again be needed for a return to the Mountains.

 It will provide Inspiration for dreams and future goals.

It will provide a sense of Thankfulness and Humility. For what we were lucky enough to be part of.

Bring on 2020 !!

Thanks again to all 2019 CCC Riders.
