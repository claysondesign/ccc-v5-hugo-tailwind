All hotels are booked. Routes designed. Staff waiting. But Covid is still determined to keep us all in suspense. There are some Plan B options, but it might not be easy. One day at a time. Listening to /watching media news, yet trying to remain  unaffected by the temptation to steer into Negative mode. Being thankful for what we got. Relativising our own issues with those who are hit far worse than us. There are lessons to be learnt too. Hoping we will never forget how lucky we are when we finally get back onto the High Roads together again!

Being thankful now that I can still ride my bike.
