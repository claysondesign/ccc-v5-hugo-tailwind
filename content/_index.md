key_testimonial: "“There was that common bond. It was so warm. Sometimes you don’t
  need words. You just look at each other. You’re back at the same hotel that you
  started at. You recall being full of trepidation and doubt, and then you’re sitting
  there, 11 days later, and your whole world has changed. It’s extraordinary.”"

If you are thinking of registering for a Cent Cols Challenge, please take time to read through all the information on this site. These events have been called “life-changing” by many, a description that has not been chosen randomly!

The list of planned events up to 2022 can be [found on the about page](/about#the-final-four-phil-years "Planned rides until 2022").

**THESE ARE TOUGH RIDES. YOU SHOULD NOT BE AFRAID OF DAWN-TO-DUSK DAYS ON OCCASIONS. YOU WILL BE TAKEN OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE ALL TOO OFTEN, BUT YOU WILL LEARN TO LOVE THAT!**

**"Am I capable of riding this? How much training time do I need to ride this?" Velo Pro, the official training partner of the Cent Cols Challenge, can help you answer these questions and can then go on to give you the confidence of having prepared for the event perfectly.
