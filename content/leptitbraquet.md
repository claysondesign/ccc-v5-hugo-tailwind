**There is still some up-hill work to do on "Le P'tit Braquet" cycling Gite project, but we're getting there!**

Le P'tit Braquet (rough translation: "The Inner Ring") is a self-catering 'gite' project 'chez Phil & Claire', in the heart of the Belgian Ardennes. It will consist of three twin, en-suite bedrooms; spacious living-room + dining room; fully equipped kitchen; utility room; bike store + bike workshop; barbecue balcony; and access to a garden.

We will open this in the spring of 2020. It will provide the perfect base from which to discover this area, with the guided help of Phil's regional knowledge if required.
