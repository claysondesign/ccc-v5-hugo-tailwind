A Special Edition one-off CCC held in a region that has been particularly badly affected by the CV19 crisis. The journey includes some of the best roads of the Lombardy region, but opens and closes with some familiar 'CCC Dolomites roads' from the Trentino and Veneto regions.

With its 'figure of eight' design, this event provides a logistically simple option to ride either FIVE or all TEN stages. Part One heads EAST and includes some roads familiar to CCC Dolomites riders. Part two heads WEST, and includes a double-night stay in a very special hotel near Bellagio, with panoramic views over Lake Como. Some classics climbs such as Mortirolo and Vivione round off this unique journey. Limited places will be on sale in July 2020.
