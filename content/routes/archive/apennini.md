intro_text: "Setting aside the Blockhaus climb, this ride includes few Grand Tour
  legends. Neither does it include many climbs higher than 1600m. Nor does it have
  many kilometres of that perfect, smooth, dark Italian tarmac. What it does have,
  though, is perhaps the greatest sense of ‘journey’ of any CCC.\n\n"

The landscape is so varied. The roads take us to some very, very remote places ; gravel climbs feature several times and the rough tarmac typical of the poor Marche and Abruzzi regions we ride through can often be a challenge in itself. The Gran Sasso opens it’s roads to us on two Stages and for these days alone this trip will prove to be unforgettable. Apart from one Stage in the reassuring ‘civilised’ beauty of Tuscany, the rest of this event scares and excites me equally, as an organiser and a rider, such is the unusual, and unpredictable nature of this part of Italy. Truly a voayage of discovery - the perfect way to illustrate what a Cent Cols Challenge is all about.

{{< testimonial cite="Tim McInnes, CCC Rider 2018" >}}
We had people from past trips watching us on social media. That’s something pretty special, and something pretty difficult to create. It’s also something that wouldn’t happen with other events. “The most mental thing I ever saw on Strava…” said a friend. He’s got a point about it all being a bit crazy. It was. And that’s why it was so great.
