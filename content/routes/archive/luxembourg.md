intro_text: Starting with the choicest climbs around La Roche en Ardenne, this event offers a chance to discover THE BEST OF LUXEMBOURG and concludes by taking on the finale climbs of L-B-L, as it returns into Belgium. Two Belgian stages book-end three full stages in Luxembourg to discover it’s abundant ultra-smooth tarmac and it’s Alpine-style ups & downs. Highly recommended for some early ‘mountain’ training!
