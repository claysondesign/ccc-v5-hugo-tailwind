intro_text: This event offers an experience of Italian « grandeur » that might be
  hard to beat. The scenery and roads are almost ‘operatic’ - oozing drama, romance,
  and almost tiringly high in emotion. Only three of the ten stages actually take
  place in the region of the Dolomites National Park , where the classic, iconic ‘monuments
  in rock’ provide an unforgetable centrepiece to our long journey.

{{< testimonial cite="Chris Fischer, CCC Rider 2017, 2018" >}}
Riding a Cent Cols Challenge became increasingly about conquering mountains of the mind as much as of the road as the event progressed. That brought lessons I could take away and apply to all areas of life.
