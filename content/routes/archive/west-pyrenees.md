intro_text: Where the Basque Country meets the Iraty region, with it’s single track
  roads, open plateaux and gradient that can be as scary as it can painful, is a place
  where, alone on a bike, our crazy universe we live in somehow makes sense.

The two mid-event stages, in the High Pyrenees, with over 6,000m of UP each and separated by a rest day, most surely provide the ultimate dawn-to-dusk ride experience possible on a road bike. The modest and soulful architecture ; the nonchalant chimes of the cow and sheep bells ; the gushing chorus of running water in road-side streams and cascading waterfalls ; the total absence of  noisy towns to cross all these combine to create a near sensorial overload! The rough, technical and demanding nature of the riding itself, with roads that are often ‘tired’ and covered in animal ‘dejections’ is almost enhanced by the perfection of the natural surroundings. There are few places as good as this to ride…
**THIS EVENT IS ESPECIALLY TOUGH, POSSIBLY THE HARDEST CCC OF THEM ALL!**
