**Final Chance to ride this route**

This route explores the warmer and dryer side of the Pyrenees, from the Girona hills to a specific stage dedicated to the climbs of Andorra, then on into the heart of the High Pyrenees. Three nights mid-event spent in Bagneres de Luchon include a NEW STAGE built around the exceptional climb up to the mountain lakes of Cap de Long, Aubert and Orédon. Having climbed many of the most beautiful Pyrenees climbs such as Port de Bales, Portillon, Agnes, Pailheres, and Superbagneres, the route explores the Arriege region before returning to Girona via a stunning coastal excursion through the Banyuls vineyards. Overall an extremely varied ride through some of the most beautifully challenging  and remote parts of the Spanish and French Pyrenees.

On the morning of stage two I thought I’d be lucky to finish four stages.On the morning of stage ten, I was so sad that it would soon be all over. I’ll be back soon! Thanks so much.
