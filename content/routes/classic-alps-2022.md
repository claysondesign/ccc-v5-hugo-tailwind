This route first explores the back roads of Nice,with a pleasant loop stage, before heading due west towards the Verdon region for some dramatic views of the famous Gorges. From here, we cross the purple plateaux of 'Lavender Provence' on our way to Sisteron, via the eastern end of the Luberon massif. A choppy ride awaits as we approach the Giant of Provence. The Ventoux stage is naturally the headliner for many who ride this event. We even take on some extra climbs as well as the three ascents, to make this day out quite exceptional. After a slightly less tough "transition" stage heading back east, we arrive in the Alpes de Haute Provence for some truly iconic climbs such as Allos, Cayolle, Champs, Bonnette. An excursion into Italy allow us to include the wonderful Agnel, Sampeyre and Dei Morti climbs. Which just leaves us to find a way back into France... the CCC has an option that groups have loved for several years now. The cols of Braus, Bruis, Turini and Chateauneuf mean that this journey remains "lively" right until the end!

That Ventoux stage. But then each stage felt like the best day on a bike ever, until the next day!
