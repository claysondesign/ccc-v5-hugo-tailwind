## THESE TERMS

All Cent Cols Challenge trips are provided by A2OEApS,   and are subject to these terms and conditions. By booking your trip and paying a deposit you confirm that you are over the age of 18 and have read, understood and accept these terms and conditions in their entirety.

## PRICE AND PAYMENT

We reserve the right to increase or decrease prices at any time. Once you have booked your trip and paid your deposit, the price shown on your booking confirmation is the guaranteed price of your trip unless there has been an obvious and manifest error. All advertised prices are inclusive of VAT. You must pay for your trip in full at least 60 days prior to your departure date. If you fail to pay for your trip in full 60 days prior to your departure date, we reserve the right to cancel your booking and your deposit will be forfeited.

## CURRENCY

All payments will be made in Euros.

## YOUR OBLIGATIONS

**You shall:** follow the instructions of your Cent Cols Challenge professional guide at all times; ensure that you are of an appropriate level of fitness to participate in your trip; notify us of any medical ailments from which you suffer which may affect your ability to participate in the trip; wear a helmet at all times whilst cycling; not cycle when under the influence of alcohol or drugs.

**Insurance:** it is a condition of these terms that you have adequate travel insurance. It is your responsibility to ensure that the insurance fully covers all of your personal requirements including cancellation charges, medical expenses and repatriation in the event of an accident or illness. Your insurance must also cover you for cycling activities and the associated risks as well as your baggage and cycling equipment. If you chose to travel without adequate insurance cover, we will not be liable for any losses arising in respect of which insurance cover would otherwise have been available.

**Bike maintenance:** Cent Cols Challenge trips may include terrain that you may not be used to cycling on day to day. It is your responsibility to ensure your bike is serviced before your trip and is in a safe and roadworthy condition. We will not be liable for any damage or injury caused as a result of a failure caused by your bike, or its operation. It is your responsibility to bring with you any unique tools, electronic shifting chargers, or special components which may be required for your bike.

## IF YOU WISH TO CANCEL YOUR TRIP

Should you wish to cancel your booking, you must give us notice of this by emailing mailto:info@centcolschallenge.com. Once we receive your cancellation notice we will follow up with an email confirming your cancellation. Your cancellation will take effect from the date that you receive our email confirming your cancellation. In the event that you cancel your trip, the following cancellation charges will apply (the charges are expressed as a percentage of your total trip price):

* more than 60 days prior to departure: your deposit†;
* between 60 and 31 days prior to departure: 50% of the trip fee;
* 30 to 0 days prior to departure: 100% of the trip fee.

† You are entitled to transfer your deposit only if you inform us at least 60 days prior to your departure date. Your deposit will then be transferable for 2 calendar years from your payment date. Please note that the deposits are not refundable and can be transferred to another departure only once. In exceptional circumstances we may concede a refund but with an administration deduction of 250€. 

## IF YOU WISH TO TRANSFER YOUR FULL BALANCE

If you have paid for your full balance (deposit + single/double occupancy) and notify us more than 60 days prior to departure, you are entitled to transfer your monies to another trip.

You must transfer to another trip departing in the same calendar year and of the same trip type.

Please note there will be an administration fee of 50€ to make this balance transfer.

## LODGING

Our prices are based on double occupancy (two people per room). If you’re traveling solo on any of our trips, we’ll assign you a roommate of the same gender. There is no extra charge if we can’t find you a roommate. You can guarantee yourself a private room if you pay the Single Room Fee.

### Single room:

As an optional extra, a person traveling solo on any trip may reserve a room for his or her exclusive use. This will guarantee you a private room and private bath every night in most locales. Note that single rooms are often smaller than double rooms.

Please note that a single room will be only guaranteed upon payment of your balance as it is subject to hotel availability.

## LATE ARRIVAL/EARLY DEPARTURE

On almost all of our trips it is possible to join us a day or two after we depart or leave a day or two early. If your schedule doesn’t mesh with ours, give us a call and see how our in-depth knowledge of the area will make it work for you. However, it is not possible for us to prorate your trip fee based on the time you’re on the trip.

## TRANSPORTATION TO THE TOUR

We will try and help with a transfer to the hotel on the eve of the event start, but this will depend on specific event logistics.  We cannot promise to provide transfers. We will collate your travel information and endeavour to make arrangments with other riders easier for transport-sharing.

## OUR RIGHTS

We reserve the right t
o cancel or alter your trip at any time prior to your departure date, due to events outside of our control, such as but not limited to: acts of God, flood, drought, earthquake or other natural disaster; epidemic or pandemic; terrorist attack, civil war, civil commotion or riots, war, threat of or preparation for war, armed conflict, imposition of sanctions, embargo, or breaking off of diplomatic relations; nuclear, chemical or biological contamination; or collapse of buildings, fire, explosion or accident, (together “Events Outside Of Our Control”). We also reserve the right to cancel or alter your trip at any time prior to your departure date (at our discretion), although we assure you that we will endeavour to only do this when strictly necessary.

## IN THE EVENT THAT WE CANCEL YOUR TRIP

We will provide you with a 200€ credit to use on another Cent Cols Challenge trip departing over the proceeding two years. You will also be entitled to: (a) book any other available trip; or (b) receive a full refund of all monies paid. We will not be liable for any flight or insurance costs you have incurred **(it is for this reason that we recommend you delay booking flights and arranging insurance until your trip is confirmed)**. We reserve the right to stop you from participating on your trip if you: behave in an abusive and/or threatening manner; or engage in illegal activities.

## INSURED DEPOSIT

Cent Cols Challenge is  committed to customer satisfaction and consumer financial protection. We are therefore pleased to announce that, at no extra cost to you, all passengers booking with Cent Cols Challenge are fully insured for the initial deposit, and subsequently the balance of monies paid as detailed in your booking confirmation form. The policy will also include repatriation if required, arising from the cancellation or curtailment of your travel arrangements due to the insolvency of Cent Cols Challenge.

## DATA PROTECTION

We will use the personal information you provide us in accordance with our Privacy Policy and these Terms and Conditions.

## GENERAL

We may transfer our rights and obligations under these terms to another organisation, and we will always notify you in writing if this happens, but this will not affect your rights or our obligations under these terms. This arrangement is between you and Cent Cols Challenge.  No other person shall have any rights to enforce any of its terms. Each of the paragraphs of these terms operates separately. If any court or relevant authority decides that any of them are unlawful, the remaining paragraphs will remain in full force and effect. If we fail to insist that you perform any of your obligations under these terms, or if we do not enforce our rights against you, or if we delay in doing so, that will not mean that we have waived our rights against you and will not mean that you do not have to comply with those obligations. If we do waive a default by you, we will only do so in writing, and that will not mean that we will automatically waive any later default by you.
