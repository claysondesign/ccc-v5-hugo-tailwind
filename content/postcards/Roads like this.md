Is it more about the Roads or the Mountains ? ![](/images/RH5D7386.jpg)

No, it's about the way the two of them produce something that is often indescribable.

At times they will generously carry you on waves of euphoria; at other moments they will ruthlessly  crunch you to bits and you will have to pick up your pieces as best you can.

At times they will reassure your sense of belonging, yet with a lovely sense of detachment, as you look down to the world you came from but are physically and metaphorically above ; then at others they will lead you away from all of what you know. You dare to follow, but worry where you will be taken. The adventure has begun.

But most of all, I am attracted to Mountains for the sense of Eternity they give me.

What do they do for you ?
