**For the Cent Cols Challenge a lot of time is spent preparing for and fearing the climbs. What can you tell us about the descents?**

Ha, good point. I thought once of announcing the difficulty of each stage by the total down, not the up! This aspect of the Challenge is often under-estimated. Descending is a BIG part of the Challenge. It demands maximum concentration from the riders to stay safe. Road surfaces can vary, adding another aspect of the tecnicality of some descents. I enoy teaching riders how to descend efficiently and safely. I used to love and indulge in the thrill of going very fast downhill, but with age ( and a few inevitable tumbles) one sees the wisdom of giving oneself a more reasonable safety margin. I try to show riders that the key to really enjoying descending, once they have learnt a simple technique I show them, is in the FLOW, not the speed. To carve a smooth line, braking only to ‘shape’ this line, not to interrupt it, is fun and safe, not only for oneself, but for other riders behind you.

**We’ve noticed on the Cent Cols Challenge website a “Wall of Fame.” It seems like a pretty select group of riders for each challenge, what can you tell us about that?**

This is a privileged place for those riders who ride every kilometre of the route. This ‘completion rate’ can vary between 10 and 80%. Riders often put enormous pressure on themselves to not miss a single col. Then the body says “No, gimme a break!” They give in, and sometimes this can be quite an emotional moment. But they don’t give up. There is no ‘Pass or Fail’ on this event. Such is the mutual respect bewteen riders for just showing up for Stage 1, that even when a rider has to take some time in one of our vehicles, he has no feeling of ‘exclusion from an elite’. In fact, almost always, it’s a game-changer moment for the better. Riders can relax, be kinder to themselves and realise that just to be riding ten days in great comapny in amazing scenery is more than most cyclists ever get to do. That they rode 80, 90 or 100 Cols becomes secondary to most CCC riders. Yes, those who do make all 100 of course have an inner feeling of special acheivement, which is rightly recognised by their name on the Wall of Fame.

**Can you talk a bit about the importance of training for the Cent Cols Challenge? Can someone just show up and ride themselves into fitness?**

A very solid base of fitness is essential. I have seen some riders quite obviously ‘ride themselves into’ the event, but they are a lucky exception. They cheated on the hours of turbo torture the others put themselves through! The thing is, the days in the saddle are long, so recovery time is short. Think of it as a ten-day ride, only interrrupted by 6-7 hours of sleep in between stages. The best way to train for one of these Challenges is to follow a strict training program where you have a many sessions as possible in blocks of back-to-back daily rides (even 1-2 hours) followed by a period of full recovery, which is so important. I have seen some riders arrive at the event still exhausted from their training!!

**Are there any sort of athletes who are particularly suited for the Cent Cols Challenge?**

Excellent question! Yesteday, out on the bike,  I was thinking about the small number of riders I have ridden with over ten years of CCC events who have not come back and who didn’t really enjoy themselves. I came to the conclusion that us “CCC Riders” are all Romantics, to a lesser or greater degree. We are not ‘Stat Slaves’, nor are we ‘Winners, not Loosers’. You cannot climb over 15,000 ft per day for ten days just looking at your watt output or average speed. It doesn’t make sense. The scenery, the views, the jokes with your co-riders, the sunsets, the sweat and the tears. We don’t press upon each other our own acheivements : we’re riding a CCC, that says enough. We know we are doing something special, something we have worked hard to get to, and we recognise our special luck in life to be there. On a more realistic level, of course, endurance is more useful than top-end speed. Which is why 40-50 year olds are often more suited to this than 20-30 year youngsters!

**There’s always that moment where an athlete bottoms out and feels like they have nothing left to give. How do you help them continue? Have you had riders abandon the challenge?**

Oh yes, almost all CCC riders come to this crossroad. All cyclists know this feeling of hitting the bottom and wondering where any more energy is going to come from. That’s where camarederie can play such a big part. A kind word, just dropping back to ‘give a wheel’, or handing over your last energy bar, or even stopping in a café for a coffe or ice-cream can change everything. We might have a car near them with a cool drin of coke, a gel and a smile, but it’s usually thanks to one’s co-riders that things gte better! For some riders though, it does evenetually get too much and so yes, some actually quit the challenge ( very few over the years). Usually riders take a day in a support vehicle, where they sleep a LOT, and then feel ready to ride again the next day with a smile.

**At 61 you are an amazing athlete yourself. After 10 years what motivates you to keep riding with the challengers?**

I’m a lucky person, I give thanks for that daily. Not only for my physical form, bur for the passion that comes from somewhere within me. Of course I love riding my bike, but I could do that in the beautiful Ardennes region of Belgium, where I live. It’s my passion to take riders to new places, both physical and mental, that give me my “CCC Mojo” ! I am still as excited as a child to see the sun rise from behind a mountain, knowing the places we are going to be riding on that new day. Then to see the faces of my clients, at the end of a hard day’s ride, beaming with the moments they have just lived through, having survived the doubt-ditches, is something that words can’t explain. I receive words of thanks after the event ( having told me how much they hated me, on the event!) that tell of how they can see their lives from a new perspective and THAT is where I get my fuel from for another year of CCC. It’s not all about the bike! But that would need a book to explain!!
