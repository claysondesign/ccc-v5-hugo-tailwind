Finding new roads in my home patch is not that easy these days. It takes longer than it used to! Next years' hArdennes week will yet again have some surprises for the regular customers. In fact there will be quite a few new bits, especially on the first two stages, where we will be heading into the Eiffel region in Germany on the Saturday and then taking a much closer look at the Amstel race on the Sunday. Lots of new faces signed up this year too. It's always exciting to introduce riders to this area that never ceases to fire up my own enthusiasm and stimulate my appetite for getting out there, even when the hills are white and the temperature struggles to get above zeroÂ°C !
