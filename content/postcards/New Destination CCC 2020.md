Five stages of this new route driven now; five more to do in early July. Another REMOTE and very challenging route that I have been wanting to create for a long time. A part of Italy that is one of the most legendary in the history of Italian cycling. Not an easy route to design, but I am pleased with how it looks so far..... 

More details soon.
