The Piemonte region of Italy is somewhere I have been waiting to explore with the aim to produce a Cent Cols Challenge for a long time. The long wait though, with growing expectations, did anything but disappoint. With so many narrow roads leading to unexpectedly animated hill-top villages, this will be a journey where the determination of cyclists will be met with the equally ardent human spirit shown by the people who live in these fascinating hills. Here we go again for a "High Dive into the Arms of Destiny".... anyone coming with me?!!!
