Another epic CCC journey where brave souls fought against the worst weather this region had known for 70 years, almost a generation....! Rain and cold tested our metal, but the CCC Smile prevailed and our reward was two and a half days of hot sun to end with. This event will run again in 2021 and 2022. I am still amazed at how each different CCC destination continues to give such a unique experience to every other place. I guess that is part of the magic of riding in places not so many other people go. 

I will be happy to return, even for another freak weather year! ( Two years ago we rode through a heat-wave of nearly 40Â°C every afternoon!) 

See you there?
