- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: Girona Loop
  Stats: 210KM / 3000M
  Mainclimbs: Condrileu, Rajols, Gomara, Saint Hilari
  Description: In 2018 an experienced local rider rode the stage with us and admitted
    that this was the best 'loop route' of the Girona hills he had ever ridden. A
    wonderful opener which shows just why so many pro riders are based in Girona and
    ride these roads all year round.

- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Girona to Molina
  Stats: 190KM / 4600M
  Mainclimbs: Roccacorba, Caselles, Collfred, Vidra, La Creu, Merolla, La Crueta
  Description: 'After a visit to the unmissable Roccacorba climb we head north-west
    via more rolling hills which take us to one of the toughest climbs of the whole
    event : the little-known Collfred. There are three ways of scaling this one :
    we take the hardest. From here some more very ''back-roads'' lead us towards the
    well-known Crueta climb ( a regular in the Vueltas of both Spain and Catalunya)  to
    the ski-station of La Molina.'

- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Molina to Ordino
  Stats: 205KM / 4600M
  Mainclimbs: Llosse, Creu, Font Romeu, Puymorens, Envalira, Ordino
  Description: 'Into France and finishing in Andorra, this stage leads us across the
    plateau of the Cerdagne towards the "Llosse Loop" : a flying decent into impressive
    gorges followed by a tough climb through remote rugged terrain. From here we head
    towards Andorra via a long climb to the highest road point of the Pyrenees (Envalira).
    Our final 10km climb to Ordino gives us a taste of what is to come in the ''Andorra
    stage''.  '

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Ordino to Sort
  Stats: 187KM / 5300M
  Mainclimbs: Baixalis, Cortals, Engolasters, Comelia, Galina, Jouell, Canto.
  Description: Andorra is another favourite location for pro riders and this stage
    includes almost all of the favourites of this tiny Principality. With it's surprising
    contrast between the noisy, bustling valley and the tranquil scenic summits, (many
    climbs are 'up & backs'), Andorra is quite unique. Gradients are often sharp;
    road surfaces perfect; traffic almost absent. To end the stage in Spain, we cross
    the long but steady Collada di Canto, which offers us a perfect 12km descent to
    our hotel in Sort.

- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: Sort to Bagneres de Luchon
  Stats: 192KM / 5900M
  Mainclimbs: Bonaigue, Portillon, Artigue, Hospice de France, Superbagneres
  Description: 'After another long steady climb we return into France via the Col
    du Portilhon which brings us right into Bagneres de Luchon. This will be our base
    for three nights, which is no coincidence. Many of the prime climbs of the Pyrenees
    are to be found in the proximity. The second half of this stage explores three
    of the ''crown jewels'' of this typical thermal town : all three up & backs, which
    is useful if some riders are ready for an early start to the rest day! '

- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Bagneres de Luchon Loop
  Stats: 213KM / 5600M
  Mainclimbs: Peyresourde, Azet, Cap de Long, Aubert, Peyregudes, Port de Bales
  Description: 'This loop stage has a totally new design for this final year, taking
    in a very special road that has never been integrated into a CCC stage until now
    : the Y-shaped route up to the twin up & back''s of the Lac''s Cap de Long and
    Aubert, from the Lac d''Orédon offer possible the most picturesque route to be
    found anywhere in the Pyrenees. Add to this the double-ascent of the Azet and
    the finale up to the Port de Bales, the result is possible the most beautiful
    CCC stage ever ridden.....Riders will judge that for themselves if the Mountains
    grant us weather-with-views !'

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Bagneres de Luchon to Foix
  Stats: 218KM / 5470M
  Mainclimbs: Portillon, Artigue,Menté,Portet d'Aspet, Core, Rille, Peguerre, Jouels
  Description: 'We leave Luchon via the hardest side of the Portillon for a valley
    section in Spain before our first real challenge : an "old road"/ gravel climb
    through remote woodland with "Watch out for Bears" signs ( very rare to see them,
    fear not!). The 18-20% sections on the Aspet are no easier. The Core is steadier
    and a superb rural climb, giving some time to ''recover'' before the long tough
    climb to the Col de Peguerre via it''s little ridden north side. From here we
    can enjoy a technical but thrilling descent to the medieval town of Foix. '

  Locations: Foix to Ax les Thermes
  Stats: 193KM / 5440M
  Mainclimbs: " Prat d'Albis, Plateau de Beille, Pradel, Ax-les Trois Domaines"
  Description: 'Our last stage in the High Pyrenees and with three iconic up & back
    Tour de France ascents.  Straight out of Foix onto the Prat d''Albis (Adam Yates
    won here in 2019, it''s first Tour appearance) before  we rise up onto the wonderfully
    scenic "Route des Cretes"before plunging down again to cross the valley for the
    Plateau de Beille climb. Back onto the "Cretes" and round a big loop via the formidable
    Col de Pradel before coming down to Ax-les Thermes for our final challenge up
    to the Trois Domaines ski station. Quite a menu!  '

  Locations: Ax les Thermes to Amelie les Bains
  Stats: 184KM / 4400M
  Mainclimbs: Port de Pailheres, Moulis, Jau, Roquejalere,Palomeres, Xatard
  Description: The mighty Port de Pailheres is our royal gateway out of the High Pyrenees,
    leading us into the Arriege region with it's arid, rocky landscape, dotted with
    the impressive ruins of the Cathar castles. Climbs are less steep but just as
    spectacular. Traffic is still rare; gorges plentiful. The show goes on!

  Locations: Amelie les Bains to Girona
  Stats: 190KM / 2650M
  Mainclimbs: Boussells, Mollo, Gascons, Coma del Mas, Bosc del Margalla, Portell.
  Description: 'A lumpy start across some short, narrow climbs until we reach the
    Mediterranean coast to begin our tour of the Banyuls vineyards, choosing the high
    roads for vast views of the vines and azur sea. Once back into Spain roads become
    more rolling, tarmac perfect and we roll our way along the coast until it''s time
    to climb inland and up to the impressive monastery at the top of the Margalla
    climb. From here we weave our way along quite lanes across the plain towards Girona
    where we end our journey by climbing the favourite local climb known as Los Engels,
    just outside Girona. '
