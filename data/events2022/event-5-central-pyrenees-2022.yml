  Description: 'A gentle-ish intro via the foothills around Lourdes leads us back
    into the heart of the Pyrenees, the stage ending with the superb duet of Spandelles
    and Hautacam. These two very contrasting climbs enclose the charming town of Argeles-Gazost,
    our destination for the night. Many ''new'' CCC roads here since we have time
    to explore the lesser ridden part of this area. '

- Stage: Stage 44
  Locations: Esterencuby &ndash; Esterencuby
  Stats: 125kms / 5300m
  Mainclimbs: Too many unpronounceable Basque names !
  Description: Perhaps a shorter stage than usual, , but this stage could prove to
    be the hardest of all 65 stages. Every climb is an exercise in 'HC Basque Steepness'.
    One comfort will be that this loop stage allows us a second night at a quite unique
    family hotel in the Middle of Nowhere!
