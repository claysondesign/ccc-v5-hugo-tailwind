    the real pearl of the stage is the climb up to the ancient village of Sotres (Collada
    de Caballar) , another often-visited Vuelta summit finish. We're in the Big Hills
    now, for sure!

  Stats: 203km / 6030m
  Mainclimbs: Gamoniteiro, Angliru
  Description: 'This has to be one of the stand-out stages of them all : a combination
    of the two most feared climbs of the Asturias. The Loop of all loops! I have wanted
    to share this loop stage with CCC riders for years and finally here it is! There
    will be much-needed rest day after this one. The 60th stage just had to be special
    in some way. I think this one will be step up to all expectations. '
