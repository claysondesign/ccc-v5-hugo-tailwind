    wooded climb offers an equally generous vista of what follows from it''s summit. '

  Mainclimbs: Port de Pailheres, Dent, Auzines, Palomere
  Description: The Crown Climb ( Pailheres)  of the Arriege region opens this stage
    and offers riders superb vistas of the Canigou Massif from the top. Beyond can

    rich in impressive Cathar castle ruins several of which will be seen on this stage.
    The dense network of narrow roads makes this area a treat to explore. You may
    even see a bear....!

  Locations: Girona &ndash; Girona
  Stats: 188kms / 3000m
  Mainclimbs: El Far, Palomera, Sesplanes
  Description: The Girona Hills are deservedly favoured by many pro's as the perfect
    training ground. Gradients are never too harsh, roads flow in a twisty dance with
    the landscape and the gentle climate makes this area very special for cyclists
    to explore. The gravel network is equally impressive, so we have to include a
    bit here and there!
