    region.  '

- Stage: Stage 64
  Locations: Reinosa &ndash; Puente Viesgo
  Stats: 185kms / 4300m
  Mainclimbs: Jumedre, Mattonella, Trueba, Lunada
  Description: 'The first of two sensational stages to finish this odyssey with. Both
    explore the best of Cantabria. The highlight of this stage has to be the first
    of our two ascents of the Portillo de Lunada. Both sides provide a moment of isolation,
    contemplation and sheer admiration in equal amounts! '

- Stage: Stage 65
  Locations: Puente Viesgo &ndash; Santander
  Stats: 163kms / 4200m
  Mainclimbs: Lunada, Sia, Espina
  Description: 'As luck would have it, two of my favourite climbs in Northern Spain
    are to be found in this final stage. Such a contrast : the Lunada climb deserves
    this second ascent, with all it''s majestic grandeur and gently snaking roads
    that hug the hillside; whereas the Collada di Espina, is a savage, raw and excessive
    battle with gravity. The whole spectrum of ''riding sensations'' in one stage!
    Not a bad way to wrap up 65 stages of bicycle, mountain roads and willing legs!'
