  Mainclimbs: Croix Blanche, Spandelles, Hautacam ( Tramassel)
  Description: 'A gentle-ish intro via the foothills around Lourdes leads us back
	into the heart of the Pyrenees, the stage ending with the superb duet of Spandelles
	and Hautacam. These two very contrasting climbs enclose the charming town of Argeles-Gazost,
	our destination for the night. Many ''new'' CCC roads here since we have time
	to explore the lesser ridden part of this area. '
