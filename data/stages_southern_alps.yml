- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: Carros Loop
  Stats: 204KM / 3950M
  Mainclimbs: Vence, Pimpinier, Bleine, Ecre
  Description: 'A perfect intro stage to the magic of the Southern Alps with iconic
    climbs such as the cols of Vence and Bleine combined with some lesser-ridden roads,
    packed with gorges, corniche roads, and panoramas towards both the Mediterranean
    and the Mountains. Quality tarmac and no steep passages should make this stage
    a real leg-loosener for the nervous CCC peloton. '

- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Carros to Castellane
  Stats: 196KM / 4580M
  Mainclimbs: Vé Gauthier, Rourebel, Valberg, Buis, Sainte Barnabé
  Description: After some more of the better back roads of the Maritime Alps, we take
    on the first mountain summit in the ski station of Valberg. The descent through
    the purple Gorges de Dalius is a star feature of this stage, as is the cheeky
    Col du Buis, ( only four kms, but very 'memorable' ones!). Remains a steady climb
    up above the Lac du Verdon which affords superb views of the turquoise waters
    as well as the best descent of the event so far, into the very charming tourist
    town of Castellane.

- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Castellane to Sisteron
  Stats: 197KM / 3900M
  Mainclimbs: Abauc, Chateauneuf, Corobin, Hyssope
  Description: 'A truly spectacular stage opening with a passage through the marvellous
    Gorges du Verdon and concluding with the fascinating "Route du Temps" through
    the geological National Park above Sisteron. Some steep passages and some very
    remote areas mark this transition stage between the Var and the Vaucluse. '

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Sisteron to Malaucene
  Stats: 212KM / 3890M
  Mainclimbs: La Lure, Negron, Muze, Perty, Ey, Perponcher, Propriac
  Description: 'The "Ventoux''s Little Brother" ( Montagne de la Lure) opens this
    stage with a 22km classic rise to the satellite masts. From here we cross due
    west towards Ventoux Country, via the impressive Cols du Negron and Perty. With
    scary views up to the Mighty Ventoux, we weave our way up and over view yards
    north the of the Bald One to the historic town of Vaison la Romaine, our base
    for three nights.  '

- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: 'Malaucene loop : V,V,Ventoux'
  Stats: 198KM / 5600M
  Mainclimbs: Notre Dame des Abeilles, Suzette, Mont Ventoux-N, Mont Ventoux-E, Mont
    Ventoux-S
  Description: 'The stand-out stage of this event, of course : a triple ascent of
    the Mont Ventoux with the gorges de la Nesque and two other considerable ''bumps''
    adding to the fun. This circular route pays tribute to the "Giant of Provence"
    by tackling it first from Malaucene, then from Sault and finally from the classic
    Bedoin side. A big day out which will be unforgettable, hopefully for good reasons!
    (In case of a ''weather window'' between bad-weather days, we will ride this stage
    AFTER our rest day.)'

- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Malaucene to Gap
  Stats: 204KM / 4220M
  Mainclimbs: Soubeyrand, Reychasset, Espreaux, Foureysasse
  Description: A final fling amongst the barren hills north of the Ventoux, with more
    impressive views towards the King of Provence and then on across the southern
    part of the Drome region towards the balcony roads that will take us through National
    Park and down into Gap, our gateway to the High Alps. This is our transition stage
    back to the Alpes de Haute Provence and should offer riders something of an easier
    stage before taking on the Higher Roads of this event.

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Gap to Barcelonette
  Stats: 204KM / 4730M
  Mainclimbs: Garcinets, Saint Jean, Allos, Champs, Cayolle
  Description: After a couple of 'warm-up' climbs out of Gap we hit the Ubaye valley,
    leaving the Lac de Serre Poncon behind on our left and heading towards the first
    of the Garnd Finale climbs of this event. An outstanding trilogy of three classic
    Alpine climbs ends this stage in an almost loop from and back to Barcelonette.
    The Allos is the most frequented of the three; the Champs the most remote, and
    the Cajole the most impressive ' and also the longest and toughest, and so naturally
    the one saved for the end! Alpine Classic can get no better !

- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Barcelonette to Guillestre
  Stats: 190KM / 5020M
  Mainclimbs: Bonette de Restefond, Lombarde, Larche, Vars
  Description: Another Classic Alpine stage first going over the highest paved road
    in Europe, then taking on the often-used Col de Lombarde in the Giro ( which takes
    us down temporarily into Italy. A long steady rise to the wide open Col de Larche
    brings us back into France where the toughest side of the Col de Vars awaits us
    to end another day with the Alpine Giants.

- Stage: Stage Nine
  Locations: Guillestre to Cuneo
  Stats: 192KM / 5200M
  Mainclimbs: Agnel, Sampeyre, Essischie, Dei Morti
  Description: 'The Feast of Alpine Giants continues here with the magnificent Col
    d''Agnel bringing us back into Italy an dropping us to the foot of the narrow,
    wooded climb to the Colle di Sampeyre. This is merely a taster of the magic to
    follow on the Essischie/ Dei Morti climb, with the most impressive monument tribute
    to Il Pirata ( Marco Pantani) at it''s summit. Perhaps the best descent of the
    event follows, before a quiet cycle route provides a relaxed run-in to Cuneo for
    a well earned pizza and gelato! '

- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Cuneo to Carros
  Stats: 187KM / 4150M
  Mainclimbs: Tende, Braus, Bruis, Turini, Chateauneuf, Aspremont
  Description: 'A long steady haul up to the Colle di Tende is our way back into France,
    where we have to ride four kms of downhill gravel road as part of an unforgettable
    64-hairpin descent! From here our day is far from done. The Bruas and Brouis are
    typical local favourite climbs but are then outshone by the imperial Col de Turini,
    which is often considered the most beautiful climb of this area. A couple of shorter,
    but steeper climbs are on our route back to Carros, where the magnitude of this
    epic journey will start to dawn on all CCC riders! '
