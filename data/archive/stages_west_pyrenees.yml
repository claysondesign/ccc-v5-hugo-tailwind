- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: San Sebastian Loop
  Stats: 214 KM / 4,500 M
  Mainclimbs: Alto de Ezkurra, Collado de Arritxulegi
  Description: A vicious start to the journey with almost every climb hitting double-digit
    gradient regularly. Wooded lanes lead up to sea-view ridges.

- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Sebastian - Esterencuby
  Stats: 179 KM / 4,200 M
  Mainclimbs: Col des Abeilles, Col d'Ispeguy, Arnosteguy
  Description: More steep, narrow backroads lead us into France where the landscape
    opens up as we climb into the rugged, impressive hills of the Iraty region of
    the Pays Basque. Single track roads take us above the tree line and along open
    ridges with 360 degree views. Climbs are steep, descents technical. Our hotel
    is equally as unique, tucked away in a remote Iraty valley.

- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Esterencuby - Oloron
  Stats: 190 KM / 5,200 M
  Mainclimbs: Col d'Inharpu, Col d’Asqueta, Bagargui, Port Larrau, Pierre St Martin,
    Soudet.
  Description: Another ultra-steep Basque climb opens the stage, bringing us back
    onto the Iraty plateau for more exceptional views. Once over the ‘back-side’ of
    the Bagargui, we head up towards the monumental Port Larrau across some of the
    wildest scenery of the Pyrenees. A short Spanish valley section before climbing
    back into France via the Col de Pierre St Martin and then we can enjoy a long
    descent into the ‘foothills’, across which we weave our way to Oloron.

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Oloron - Argeles Gazost
  Stats: 175 KM / 4,800 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de Soudet, Marie Blanque, Aubisque, Col de Spandelles
  Description: Four classic climbs make this stage more ‘iconic’ - our second visist
    to the Pierre St Martin mountain opens, followed quickly by the tough but short
    Marie Blanque. The Aubisque, via its tougher western side is next, with the glorious,
    lesser known Col de Spandelles closing the stage that brings us for three nights
    to Argeles-Gazost in the heart of the High Pyrenees.

- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: Argeles Loop
  Stats: 207 KM / 5,700 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de Croix Blanche, Courade, Col du Tourmalet, Col des Tentes, Hautacam.
  Description: This loop stage begins with some ‘foothills’ climbs that are an anything-but-gentle
    prelude to our first ascent of the mighty Tourmalet, from the La Mongie side.
    The up-and-back climb to the Col des Tentes is rarely ridden but so worth the
    effort for it’s exceptional views towards the top. But perhaps the best is kept
    to last for this stage as the day draws to a close with the classic ascent of
    the Hautacam. Rest Day will be welcome!

- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Argeles - St Lary Soulan
  Stats: 188 KM / 6,300 M
  Mainclimbs: Col de Luz Ardiden, Tourmalet, Beyrede, Col d'Aspin, Hourquette d'Ancizan,
    Portet
  Description: No less than six of the seven climbs on this stage feature regularly
    on the Tour. Possibly the Queen stage of our journey, this could be called the
    CCC version of the infamous 'Circle of Death'. The Col de Beyrede may not a Tour
    name, but it still places the steepest gradients of the whole stage! The Col du
    Portet provided the final mountain-top finish of the Tour in 2018 and is a more
    than worthy stage-closer here.

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: St Lary - Portalet
  Stats: 2OO KM / 5,650 M
  Mainclimbs: Azet-Louron, Hourquette d’Ancizan, Lancon, Soulor, Puerto o Paso del
    Portalet
  Description: After another Tour classic climb (Azet-Louron), we tackle the Hourquette
    climb on it’s tougher side, to pass by the Plateau de Payolle once more before
    heading across the ‘foothills’ to the Soulor, again via it’s harder side. Once
    the Aubisque crested, the 25km climb to the Col de Portalet awaits to lead us
    to our surreal mountain-top hotel.

- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Portalet - Jaca
  Stats: 205 KM / 3,400 M
  Mainclimbs: Puerto de Cotefablo, Mont Oroel
  Description: A fully Spanish stage with some of the wildest sections of the whole
    event. Stunning roads and mountain vistas complement less harsh gradients to make
    this a remarkable contrast to the other stages. A nice wooded ‘broken road’ climb
    chips in to close the stage before a fast descent into Jaca.

- Stage: Stage Nine
  Locations: Jaca - Borguete
  Stats: 195 KM / 5,350 M
  Mainclimbs: Paso de Somport, Soudet, Bagargui, Ibenata.
  Description: Via the Col de Somport, this stage takes us back into France to tackle
    the third, and perhaps hardest side of the Soudet. The Col de Bagargui hits us
    even harder, with its 'average %' signs of 11,12, 13 and 13.5 - one of the hardest
    in the Pyrenees, for sure. After a final treat of beauty on the plateaux of Iraty,
    we finally head back into Spain via a steady, gentler climb to the Puerto de Ibenata.

- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Borguete - San Sebastian
  Stats: 208 KM / 3,700 M
  Mainclimbs: Santuario de Aralar
  Description: To close this tough route across the Pyrenees, our return to the Basque
    hills is marked first by the extraordinary climb to the Santuria de Aralar, where
    the bravest can go right up to the weather station. Five more climbs stand between
    us and the sea and they will not let you forget them easily!
