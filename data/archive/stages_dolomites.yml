stages:
- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: San Pellegrino Terme - Pieve di Ledro
  Stats: 186 KM / 4700 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo San Zeno, Passo di Crocedomini
  Description: A stunning opening stage, with a 26km climb after just 4km to open
    the show. The real feature of the day is the Passo Maniva, then a long descent
    to our lakeside hotel on the Lago di Ledro.
- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Pieve - Fiera di Primero
  Stats: 186 KM / 4700 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo Bordola, Passo di Compet, Passo Brocon
  Description: Arriving at Lake Garda via the old corniche ‘road’, we are treated
    to superb views before we head north-east for our climbs. The star of the day
    is the climb towards Vignola, our first of many narrow roads that hairpins through
    dense woodland. A real treat.
- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Fiera - Tolmezzo
  Stats: 200 KM / 5100 M
  Mainclimbs: Cerada, Passo Duran, Passo Cibiana, Mauria, di Bivio.
  Description: Passo Cerada is literally our wake up call today, signalling we have
    arrived in the heart of the Dolomites. The famous rock skylines set the tone for
    some dramatic rides to follow. The stage ends with a couple of nice, 'backroad'
    tough climbs.
- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Tolmezzo - Misurina
  Stats: 174 KM / 5350 M
  Mainclimbs: Avaglio, Zoncolan, Passo Ciampagiotto, San Antonio, Tre Cime di Lavaredo
  Description: Monte Zoncolan and Tre Cime book-end this epic stage. Neither will
    'disappoint', despite their fearsome reputation. But the stage has many other
    unforgettable moments as our route winds through the National Park. A new hotel
    for this year on the Lago Misurina promises to make the perfect end to this big
    day out !
- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: Misurina - Canazei
  Stats: 170 KM / 4870 M
  Mainclimbs: Tre Croce, Passo di Giau, Falzarego, Gardena, Sella, Fedaia
  Description: The Passo Giau, considered one of the most beautiful passes in Italy,
    is our opener but what follows will not disappoint. The Gardena and Sella passes
    can be enjoyed as examples of mountain perfection, and with the Pordoi form the
    Sella Ronde. The Fedaia (Marmolada) closes Part One of our journey with cruel
    beauty!
- Stage: REST DAY
- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Canazei - Levico Terme
  Stats: 201 KM / 5180 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo Ochini, Rolle, Lavaze, Passo Manghen
  Description: After a rest day in Canazei, in a hotel with full spa facilities, we
    travel away from the mineral heart of the Dolomites but nonetheless have to face
    some severe climbs. Towards the end of this stage the Passo Manghen steals the
    show, with a climb to match any other in the whole route
- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Levico - Castelvecchio
  Stats: 170 KM / 4800 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo di Valbona, Vezzana, Campogrosso, Muchione.
  Description: This is one of the most remote stages, with steep roads carved into
    the mountainside and wooded climbs on narrow, deserted roads. It also has the
    only uphill finish; a steep climb to the tiny village of Castelvecchio, baptised
    ‘Little Zoncolan' by previous CCC riders!
- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Castelvecchio - Ponte Arche
  Stats: 205 KM / 5570 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo Santa Barbara, Fittanze, Del Creer, Branchetto, Ballino.
  Description: From the Veronese hills to the Lessini National Park, this stage takes
    us from woodland to barren, windswept highlands and back into the mountains. It
    contains two of the longest climbs (24km and 26km) as well as the two most dramatic
    descents of the whole event.
- Stage: Stage Nine
  Locations: Ponte Arche - Tovo
  Stats: 190 KM / 5700 M
  Mainclimbs: Passo di Gavia, Mortirola, Tonale, Campiglio.
  Description: More superb classic climbs – the Madonna di Campiglio, Tonale, Gavia
    and Mortirola make up a pretty impressive “bucket list” ride for anyone! This
    is as mighty as it can get. There is a ‘Plan B’ if weather is against us for this
    dramatic stage.
- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Tovo - San Pellegrino Terme
  Stats: 176 KM / 4300 M
  Mainclimbs: Mortirolo, Passo Vivione, Presolana, Ganda
  Description: The toughest side of the Mortirolo opens the stage. After following
    a superb ridge road to Aprica, we descend to tackle one of the most beautiful
    climbs of the event; the Passo Vivione. Which leaves the Presolana, with it’s
    successive 14% ramps, and the Passo di Ganda before our final superb descent back
    into San Pellegrino Terme.
