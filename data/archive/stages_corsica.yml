- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: Bastia to Corte
  Stats: '220 KM / 4200 M '
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Terghine, San Stefano, Bigorno, San Gavino, Casardo, San Cervone
  Description: Following a grand view of the western coast from the Col de Terghine,
    the route takes us due south across wooded hills, remote villages and over eight
    main climbs. We almost come back down to sea-level after a 26km downhill section
    , near San Guiliano, before an even longer climb due west up to the Col de Casardo.
    From here it is a bumpy ride further inland to the busy town of Corte.

- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: Corte to Corte
  Stats: 190KM / 4380M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Vergio, Sevi, Vizzavona, Serra, Bellagranajo
  Description: 'A stage of contrasts : the opening climb, the Col de Vergio, climbs
    for almost 50kms and is rightly considered the most beautiful and challenging
    on the island. Narrow roads with jaw-dropping views keep the mind busy. An equally
    entrancing road awaits on the downward side towards Porto. Then another of Corsica’s
    wildly remote roads tackles rocky hillsides taking us south-east.  It is then
    a long slog to the top of the Vizzavona, but at least the ''old road'' is still
    there for us to battle the climb away from traffic. One final smaller climb interrupts
    an otherwise perfect descent section to the stage''s end.'

- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Corte to Propriano
  Stats: 195KM / 4,250M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de San Quilico, Erbajo, Morello, Sorba, Verde, Vaccia, Ste Eustache
  Description: 'After the exceptionally beautiful climb to the Col de Sorba, the greater
    part of this stage follows the green spine of Corsica : a fabulous mixed forest
    through which the D69 struggles to find its way. Most of the tarmac on this stage
    is almost brand new; some isn’t…. The Col de Verde tops the stage, leaving three
    climbs and some fabulous descents before we end by the sea!'

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Propriano to Propriano
  Stats: 197KM / 3,900M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Bilia, Bacinu, Bocca d'Illarata, Siu.
  Description: This stage takes us from the west across to the eastern coast, via
    the impressive Col de Bacinu. Evergreen oak forests on the way over; a brief bit
    of flat road before arriving in Porto Vecchio, then the famous Ospedale (Illarata)  climb
    back up, through pine forest and boulders. True unique Corsica landscape as we
    head back to the western shore.

- Stage: Stage Five
  Locations: Propriano to Porticcio
  Stats: 165KM /  3,500M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Bavella, Vaccia,Granaccia, Bellevalle
  Description: From one port to another, our route goes inland first, heading towards
    the curious rock formation of the “Aiguilles de Bavella”. Back down through the
    charming village of Zonza, we then head north-east along more twisting roads,
    taking on the Col de Vaccia from its southern side this time, before rolling along
    a bumpy section that includes several Cols, but never any major climbs. A very
    pleasant 28km of “overall downhill” takes us to our beach hotel where we stay
    for three nights. (Including our mid-event REST DAY)

- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Porticcio to Porticcio
  Stats: " 195KM /  3,900M "
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Cortone, Chenova, Crichetto, Val d'Eze, Scalella
  Description: A southern swoop along the coast opens the stage before some sharp
    climbing inland towards the Col de Cortone which dominates the forest of Chiavari.The
    mid-stage climb to Val d'Eze is the highest road point of the island. More narrow
    roads (few back lanes are left unexplored by the end of our trip) eventually take
    us to the 20 km section to the top of the beautiful Scalella. Another long descent
    down to sea level closes the stage perfectly.

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Porticcio to Porto
  Stats: 188KM / 4,000M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de San Bastiano, Bocca di Sarcoggio, Ambiegna, Sevi
  Description: " This stage takes us first of all along the west coast along a gently
    undulating road before veering off again onto the ‘lost’ roads of the island.
    Harsher climbs are to be found along the way but the stage really comes alive
    in the last 60kms. This contains a section of truly spectacularly wild and apparently
    forgotten tarmac , followed by the severe climb up to the Col de Sevi –with its’
    12% final two kms. The 22km descent down into Porto is one of the best pieces
    of road you could ever wish to cycle on…"

- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Porto to Porto
  Stats: 170KM /  3,500M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de Vergio, Sevi, St Antoine, San Martino, Osini
  Description: 'A second shorter stage, but this one starts with the longest climb
    of the event: from sea-level to 1400m in 36kms. Descents-galore follow before
    a beautiful ridge section with distant sea views. Finally we plunge down to sea
    level for a roller-coaster ride taking us to the Grand Finale of this stage :
    part1 is the road to the beach via Col d''Osini; part 2 is the descent through
    the famous red-rock Calanches of Porto. Quite exceptional.'

- Stage: Stage Nine
  Locations: Porto to Ile Rousse
  Stats: 209KM /  3,300M
  Mainclimbs: Cols de la Croix, Salvi, Bocca di a Battaglia, San Colombano
  Description: The first part of the two-stage tour of the north of the island. An
    80km coastal stretch is a real treat to open the stage, taking us to Calvi. From
    here we turn inland for some higher view points of the azur blue Meditteranean.
    This stage includes the toughest climb of the Challenge, with a few quite steep
    bits! After this battle the rest of the stage seems gentle but always 'entertaining'
    !

- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Ile Rousse to Bastia
  Stats: '162KM /  3,100M '
  Mainclimbs: Bocca di Vezzu, Ste Lucie, Serra, San Martino di Lota
  Description: 'Across the ''Desert des Agriates'' to begin the Tour of Capi Corsu
    from St Florent up along the rocky coast on perfect roads to Abro, from where
    we take the High Road to Pino : a very dramatic piece of tarmac! Cutting east
    here across the Cap via the impressive Bocca di Ste Lucia we then descend to the
    much tamer east coast to enjoy a fast 20kms on a sweeping smooth road. But then
    we head up to San Martino for some more infinity views of the azur blue sea. This
    stage is less predictable then might be expected and makes a perfect curtain call
    to this very special series of rides.'
