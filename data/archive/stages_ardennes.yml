  Stats: 175km / 3,300m
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: 'After a sharp "warm up" tackling some of the walls along the Vesdre
    valley, ( renowned in Belgium as the valley containing the most & the steepest
    climbs !), we head directly to the AGR race area. We will watch the race on at
    least three of the main climbs, chasing from one spot to another to catch the
    action as the race pace cranks up. '

  Stats: 150kms / 3000m

    Malmedy is one of the key towns that define the unique character of the Belgian Ardennes. Surrounded by steep wooded hills which we explore 'thoroughly' !
    Our route over to Malmedy takes us through Stavelot where we will have our first taste of the 'L-B-L finale' by riding up the Stockeu. On our way back we will go round the parameter of the F1 Francorchamps circuit.

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: La Fleche Wallonne finale and a lot more...
  Stats: 210kms / 3400m
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: Our longest stage so far where we will ride all of the main climbs
    of the Fl√®che Wallonne race course as well as some of my own favourites. Impressive
    'fermes-chateaux' abound along the way on this stage across the Condroz region.
    Of course the Mur d'Huy will be one of the "highs"!

  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: Our "recovery day" mid-week, where we meander over to Huy and back
    to catch the ladies climbing the Mur twice and the men climbing it three times.

  Locations: 'Dense Forests, rolling roads but of course some nice gradients too. '
  Stats: 170kms / 3200m
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: 'A particularly beautiful route through deep forest with many of my

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: La Roche en Ardenne, Houffalize, Bastogne, Luxembourg. THE BEST.
  Stats: 251kms / 4900m
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: 'Part One of a "CCC version of LBL" : after riding the hardest of the
    climbs around La Roche en Ardenne, we head over to Houffalize to climb the famous
    Cote de Roche ( the first real challenge on the LBL race course) before heading,
    via Bastogne, into Luxembourg. The quality of the roads here and the Alpine nature
    of the climbs never fail to surprise. A super-tough day on the bike with an exceptional
    overnight stay in the town of Vianden.'

- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: 'Luxembourg, Germany, Belgium : all of the LBL "killer climbs" and so
    many more. '
  Stats: 250kms / 5300m
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: Part Two begins with more classic Luxembourg climbs before we ride
    ALL of the finale climbs of L-B-L AND more. A truly epic ride to conclude a week
    of tough rides that will leave you in no doubt about why this part of Belgium
    is so admired as THE best area to ride in the Benelux. For those who ride the
    whole eight stages, it  will also leave you very fit and very tired !!
