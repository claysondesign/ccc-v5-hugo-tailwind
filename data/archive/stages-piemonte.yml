- Stage: Stage One
  Locations: San Pellegrino Terme Loop
  Stats: 193KM / 5400M
  Mainclimbs: Passo Salmezza, Colle Gallo, Colle di San Fermo, Parzanica, Ranzanico,
    Passo Ganda
  Description: 'Sharp climbs set the scene from km five on this intro Loop stage.
    After a typical rise to a Madonna sanctuary we enjoy a sweepig descent into the
    Valle di Serio, from where tackle the Colle Gallo, known locally  as the "Picolo
    Gavia"! From here we swoop down to our first lake-side section of the event, along
    the Lago d''Iseo. This combination of steep-sided hills and tranquil lakes is
    typical of all of the Lombardy part of this Journey. After a brief flat recovery
    section, we toil our ways up to the ridiculously balanced hill-top village of
    Parzanica, before we head back down to the lake via an equally scary road! Welcome
    to CCC Piemonte! To find our way back to San Pellegrino we will take roads that
    are as narrow, remote and as steep as any we will meet in the whole event. BUT,
    we remain on tarmac! This who have ridden the CC Dolomites will recognise the
    final section of this stage over the Paso Ganda which was Col #100 on that event.
    Our own journey has only just begun !!'

- Stage: Stage Two
  Locations: San Pellegrino Terme to Como
  Stats: 196KM / 4800M
  Mainclimbs: Sant Antonio Abbandonato, Valcava, Valbrona, Madonna di Ghisallo, Muro
    di Sormano, Civiglio
  Description: 'This stage covers the best parts of the Giro di Lombardia, and a bit
    more! Another busy, but narrow and steep climb to a "Perruchia"opens the stage
    taking us over in the Valle Brembilla from where we have a shorter ''practise
    climb'' before taking on the long but wonderful Valcava climb, one of the most
    well-known of the region. An equally thrilling descent is followed by a slightly
    gentler section which brings us to the shores of the eastern ''branch'' of the
    Lago di Como. The brief flat ride along it''s shore provides a welcome relief
    before we take on the two most renowned climbs of this route : the Ghisallo and
    the Muro di Sormano. Steep will take on a new meaning for those who ride the Muro
    for the first time. From here we earn ourselves another lakeshore section before
    the Civiglio climb in Como, which is the traditional closer of the race itself. '

- Stage: Stage Three
  Locations: Como to Biella
  Stats: 206KM / 3500M
  Mainclimbs: 'Besazio, Bogogno, Brochetta di Sassera, Colle del Colma  '
  Description: 'A transition stage from Lombardy to the Piemonte region itself. Once
    round Varese and through Campo dei Fiori Regional Park, we cross into the Piemonte
    region itself on the bridge at the southern tip of Lago Maggiore. Fast rolling
    roads now bring us across the plain and into some of the spectacular hills this
    region is so well known for. The duet of the finale ''sanctuary climbs'' on this
    stage are two of the most impressive of the whole event : the first being a very
    ''civilised'' manicured affair; the second an ultra-narrow and scarily remote
    road that tops with an old chiselled tunnel. Views are the best, the road surface
    is perfect, the Albergo near the top provides one of the most perfect spots to
    stop you will ever find. '

- Stage: Stage Four
  Locations: Biella to Pinerolo
  Stats: 208KM / 4500M
  Mainclimbs: Croce Sierra, Alice Superiore, Filia, Monte di Belmonte, Forcola, Lys,
    Braida
  Description: 'An early short, sharp climb from Biella opens this stage characterised
    by several of the narrowest and often steepest roads in the region. The more frequented
    climb to the Belmonte monastery is almost a relief, such is the intensity of these
    smaller climbs! The latter part of the stage is marked by our arrival into ''Giro
    territory'', with a climb up the north side of the very impressive Colle del Lys
    (Giro 2019) followed by the Braida before a gentle run-in to Pinerolo. '

- Stage: 'Stage Five '
  Locations: Pinerolo to Cuneo
  Stats: 207KM / 53500M
  Mainclimbs: Montoso, Barge, Isasca, Sampeyre, Dei Morti
  Description: 'Having checked out the 13% cobbled climb that featured in the final
    kilometre of the Cuneo to Pinerolo stage 12 of the Giro 2019, we head up another
    nano-narrow climb before taking on the other big star of the same stage : the
    Colle Montoso. Fine Giro tarmac helps us both ascend and above all descend this
    wonderful but long ascent. Gradually we leave the dense wooded hills for more
    open landscape and join climbs familiar to CCC Southern Alps riders : the duo
    of Sampeyre and Essichie / Dei Morti are always worth the effort required to scale
    both, with some of the most impressive mountain views of the event offered by
    the latter climb. The superb descent helps us well on our way to Cuneo where we
    stay for three nights. '

- Stage: Stage Six
  Locations: Cuneo Loop
  Stats: 202KM / 5000M
  Mainclimbs: Lago di Entracque, Lombarde, Dei Morti, Esischie.
  Description: "A loop stage with the Giants, including two 'up & back's'. The first
    of these is an exceptional, seldom-ridden climb up to a mountain lake with one
    of the most impressively engineered mountain hydro stations to be found anywhere.
    \ Then, rather appropriately the Colle di Lombarde marks the southern most tip
    of our journey. Here we climb this magic mountain from it's \"better\" side !
    \nTo wrap up this simple but exquisite loop, in a similar way to the Lombarde,
    we climb the Dei Morti on it's more 'classic' side. To include two ascensions
    of this extraordinary climb in this event is a very deliberate choice : all of
    the three ways to climb this mountain are roads any High Rider should do at some
    point. That the superb statue of \"Il Pirata\"finds itself at the top confirms
    that, surely?!"

- Stage: Stage Seven
  Locations: Cuneo to Sestriere
  Stats: 192KM / 5600M
  Mainclimbs: Passo di San Pietro, Santuaire di Valmala, Agnel, Izoard, Montgenevre,
    Sestriere
  Description: 'Another intriguingly narrow Sanctuary climb opens the stage before
    we join the long introduction to the toughest side of the Colle di Agnelo. The
    highest point of the event will disappoint no one. Exquisite Mountain Beauty.
    Next up, in our little excursion into France, the harder of the two sides of the
    Izoard with it''s upward passage through the exceptional "Casse Deserte". The
    duo of the Montgenevre and the Sestriere, by the ''alternative'' road, closes
    the ''High Mountains'' section of this event, and brings us back into Italy. '

- Stage: Stage Eight
  Locations: Sestriere to Ivrea
  Stats: 223KM / 4700M
  Mainclimbs: Finestre, Lys, Passo della Croce, Dieta, Forcola
  Description: 'Ascending the Finestre on the ''tarmac side'' and descending the gravel
    side is rarely done, but just as impressive as the classic way. It''s the first
    challenge of this log stage which brings us back into the heart of Piemonte. The
    southern ascent of the Colle di Lys follows, with several tough sections and a
    grand view at the summit. From here all the way to Ivrea we are back into the
    ''steep and narrow'', exploring roads that are the lifelines of the hill-top villages
    perched stubbornly on vertiginous ridges. Our lakeside hotel ( Lago di Sirio)
    will provide a well deserved restful overnight stay. '

  Locations: Ivrea to Varese
  Stats: 193KM / 3300M
  Mainclimbs: Croce Serra, Pettinengo, Cuvignone, San Bernardo, Motta Rossa
  Description: 'Back across the plain that separates Piemonte from Lombardia, this
    stage mixes some more Sanctuary Climbs with some faster rolling roads as we approach
    the Lago di Maggiore. The Passo Cuvignone stands out as the toughest climb of
    the stage with some magnificent views. From here the stage ends with a relatively
    tame run-in to Varese via the Motta Rossa pass. '

- Stage: Stage Ten
  Locations: Varese to San Pellegrino Terme
  Stats: 194KM / 3930M
  Mainclimbs: ''
  Description: 'Mountains and Lakes : our little excursion into Switzerland takes
    us along the shores of Lago di Lugano before we cut across to the Lago di Como
    over some very "steep-in-places" roads as we cut across between the two lakes.
    A superb lake-side cycle path helps us on our way along the Lago di Como as we
    head up to it''s northern tip. From here we make our way to one of the best ways
    to finish a CCC journey yet : the ascent and descent of the very imposing Passo
    San Marco. Once above the tree line, the landscape opens up brutally to reveal
    the barren wilderness which contrasts so strikingly with the "civilised" lakes
    of northern Italy and Switzerland! The descent takes 25kms to bring our journey
    to a thrilling end! Perfettissimo !!'
